# A blog about my art :)

Here i post inspirations, i use for my art.
Although i respect and appreciate the "old masters", I mainly draw inspiration
from the modern art era until now.
I love paintings from the Expressionism, Cubism, Furusim, Dadaism, Surrealism, Minimalism,
some Photorealism (especially Richter's artwork) and last but not least, contemporism.

Besides my inspirationsources, i will post my own artwork, which will consist mainly
of paintings (acrilc), drawings, sketches and tattoo's. :)
